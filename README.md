# Document Management System (DMS) Implementation
This repository contains the planning and design documents for the implementation of a SharePoint-based Document Management System (DMS) with AI-powered document processing capabilities.

## Overview
The DMS Implementation project aims to enhance document management efficiency by centralizing storage, automating workflows, and integrating AI technologies for improved document handling and processing.

## Features
- **Centralized Document Repository**: Set up using SharePoint for unified document storage.
- **User-Friendly Configuration**: Includes navigation, layout, and folder structures for easy document retrieval.
- **Metadata Tagging and Custom Content Types**: For structured document categorization.
- **Version Control and Access Management**: Role-based access control and compliance tracking.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other project management tools.
- **Automated Workflows**: For document submission, approvals, and revisions.

### AI-Powered Document Processing
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: For automatic document categorization and metadata extraction.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhances document understanding and processing.
- **Duplicate Detection**: AI-based checks to prevent redundant document uploads.
- **Automated Summarization**: Quick review of lengthy documents for stakeholders.

## Diagrams
The project planning is visualized using draw.io diagrams, which include:
1. **Flowcharts**: Detailing workflows for document processes.
2. **System Architecture Diagrams**: Illustrating the overall structure and integration points.
3. **Process Diagrams**: Showing interactions and data flow.
4. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**: Visualizing data relationships.
5. **Swimlane Diagrams**: Highlighting roles and responsibilities.

## Usage
To view and edit the diagrams:
1. Open the `.drawio` file using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
2. Navigate through different pages or layers to explore various aspects of the DMS implementation.
